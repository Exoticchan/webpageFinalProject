                <h1>What is a TUMBLEBUS?</h1> 
                <p>
                    A TUMBLEBUS is a gym on wheels filled with fun equipment--bringing the best possible physical education class to children at daycares, elementary schools, private schools, etc. 
                    Cheerfully decorated, the TUMBLEBUS provides a unique and fun way for children to receive the physical fitness that is so important to their development. 
                    Instructors "with a special heart toward children" make the experience memorable as well as educational.
                </p>
                <p>
                    TUMBLEBUS programs are for children, walking toddler to eight years old. TUMBLEBUS classes assist in building self-esteem as they accomplish each new physical skill in the lesson plan. 
                     TUMBLEBUS is a national program. We are happy to report that over 300 buses have been manufactured and currently operate throughout the United States!
                </p>
                <h1>TUMBLEBUS Mission</h1>
                <p>
                    The mission of TUMBLEBUS is to promote the physical, emotional and social development of children. The TUMBLEBUS programâ€™s goal is to promote each child's physical, social and emotional growth through his or her accomplishments. We want the children to feel special and to be proud of each new accomplishment through positive feedback and encouragement. 
                    Exercises are designed to build coordination, strengthen muscles and bones, develop gross motor skills, rhythm, and improve perceptual motor skills. The children learn a simplified form of very basic gymnastic routines and positions in a non-competitive environment.
                </p>
                <h1>Child's Rewards</h1>
                <p>
                    Gymnastics is the foundation for many sports. The skills learned are the basis for all sports. They develop coordination, flexibility, strength, power, learn to listen and follow directions, gain self esteem, confidence, social interaction, rhythm, set goals, learn movement skills, and stay physically fit.
                </p>
                <h1>Parent's Reward</h1>
                <p>
                    Parents can feel assured of TUMBLEBUS's total commitment to safety, personal care and encouragement. Ultimately we want to make sure that their children have fun while developing gymnastics skills along with many other skills. The most significant benefit to parents is they save on valuable family evening time because the classes are held at the school during the day. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In today's world, parents struggle to take their children to and from activities due to their busy work schedules. TUMBLEBUS frees up your time along with saving money on gas, and even dinner expenses at a drive through and other restaurants. This alone saves weekly cash. At TUMBLEBUS, we're parents too! We want the best for your child.
